We know that if you simply want to learn about an animal through it's sequence
without going through the multiple steps it takes to BLAST and search it,
there is not a tool that readily does that...yet!

Our goal for this project was to create a easy and streamlined way to find 
information about an animal using their DNA or protein seuqence. Simply paste in your sequence or input your fasta file, 
click on the link containing the top hit, and read up on the information you need!

This is a useful tool if you want to research on organisms, espically if you are looking at multiple organisms. It reduces
tab clutter, and the amount the steps that it from BLAST-ing it, looking at the top hits, then search it on the web, which makes
the process faster overall. Students and researchers looking to read up on their organism will benefit from this tool the most!
